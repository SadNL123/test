        "the species of plant is usually known for the users or planters (Wang \net al., 2021). Therefore, accurate identification of plant disease and \nseverity is more important, and a new strategy for identifying disease \nand severity is needed, which can improve the versatility and general­\nizability in the task of plant disease identification. However, as far as is \nknow, we are unaware of any work that conducts multitask for identi­\nfying disease and severity simultaneously and separately. \nTo tackle this problem, this paper built a triple-branch SwinT clas­\nsification (TSTC) network to achieve multitask, in order to separate \nclassification of disease and severity for the flexibility of plant disease \nclassification. SwinT can pay attention to the relevant information of \nother adjacent windows, has excellent performance in feature extrac­\ntion. Therefore, we designed a triple-branch SwinT (TST) module based \non SwinT for feature extraction, and then compact bilinear pooling \n(CBP) was utilized to enhance the discrimination ability of extracting \nfeature of disease. Meanwhile, we designed a deep supervision module"
