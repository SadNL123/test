Then, Section 3 presents dataset, the results \nusing quantitative metrics and confusion matrix, and the comparison \nwith widely used networks. Section 4 provides visualization analysis and \ndiscusses the experiment performed. Finally, Section 5 concludes this \npaper. \n2. Method \n2.1. Overview \nThe architecture of the proposed TSTC network is illustrated in \nFig. 1. It consists of three modules: a multitask feature extraction \nmodule, a feature fusion module, and a deep supervision module. In the \nmultitask feature extraction module, we design a TST module consisting \nof sharing part and triple-branch part to extract preliminary features \nspecialized for disease and severity classification tasks. The feature \nfusion module further combines these preliminary complementary fea­\ntures using CBP technique so that these features can be enhanced. \nMoreover, the deep supervision module is used to assist the hidden \nlayers to extract more discriminative features. The workflow of the \nproposed TSTC network is as follows,",

The definitions of OA, precision, recall, and F1- \nscore are shown in Eq. (9–12). In this paper, OA is an overall indicator \nthat used to quantitatively evaluate the overall performance of the \nnetwork. Precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate accuracy of \neach category (i.e., disease type or severity). In addition, confusion \nmatrix is used to further validate the performance of the model for each \ncategory. \nOA =\nTP + TN\nTP + FP + TN + FN\n(9)  \nPrecision =\nTP\nTP + FP\n(10)  \nRecall =\nTP\nTP + FN\n(11)  \nF1 −score = 2*precision*recall\nprecision + recall\n(12)  \nwhere TP is True Positive, TN is True Negative, FP is False Positive, and \nB.

They, however, are not sufficient in the case \nwhen complex diseases occur, and may lead to unsatisfactory classifi­\ncation accuracy (Liang et al., 2019). Studies have shown that fusion of \nfeatures from different branches can help to improve classification \nperformance (Chetouani et al., 2020; Liu and Wu, 2022), which are \nattributed to the complementarity of different features. \nGiven this, a feature fusion module is organized in this paper using a \nwidely used technique, i.e., the CBP technique (Gao et al., 2016). \nDifferent from traditional addition or concatenation of two groups of \nfeatures, CBP first transforms high dimension features from different \nclassification tasks into a low dimensional space using count sketch \nprojection (CSP) function, which can reduce computation and storage \nspace (L´opez-S´anchez et al., 2020). The count sketch projection function \nis adopted because the CSP of the outer product of the input features is",

To summarize, the contri­\nbutions of this paper are, \n1) We proposed an end-to-end trainable multitask network for classi­\nfication of disease and severity simultaneously and separately to \nimprove the network’s generalization ability and the application in \nagriculture field.  \n2) We proposed a TST module, which contained sharing part and triple- \nbranch part, to extract features targeted for special task. And \nattributed to the complementarity of different features, we adopted \nCBP for further fusing cross-branch feature information to make \nfeatures more distinctive.  \n3) We explored methods for improving feature extraction ability, then \ndeep supervision module was designed to generate more distinctive \nfeaturesof hidden layers to improve the classification accuracy of \ndisease and severity. \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the \nproposed network in detail. Then, Section 3 presents dataset, the results",
        "disease, and severity are considered as joint categories in most disease classification methods, which will increase \nthe number of categories and decrease the generalization ability of these models. Compared to disease and \nseverity, information on plant species is less important because different species may suffer from the same \ndisease, and such information is usually known to users. Given this, this paper proposed a novel triple-branch \nSwin Transformer classification (TSTC) network for classification of disease and severity simultaneously and \nseparately. The TSTC network consists of a multitask feature extraction module, a feature fusion module and a \ndeep supervision module. Firstly, preliminary features are extracted using a triple-branch network, which is built \nbased on Swin Transformer backbone under the multitask classification strategy (i.e., one for disease classifi­\ncation, one for severity classification and the other for deep supervision). After that, these features are fused \nusing compact bilinear pooling technique to enhance the feature extractor’s learning ability and thus more",

As shown in Fig. 7, the confusion \nmatrix is used to demonstrate the performance of the TSTC network. The \ndiagonal of the matrix represents the number of correct disease pre­\ndictions, whereas the rest of the matrix represent misclassification. It can \nbe found that most of the leaves are predicted correctly, and only a very \nsmall number of leaves are misclassified. For example, 131 images of \nleaf mold fungus are predicted correctly and only 1 image are predicted \nincorrectly by the network. It is thus clear that the TSTC network works \nwell for classification of leaf diseases. \n3.4. Results of severity classification \nAs for severity classification, the performance of the TSTC network is \nshown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the classification results of the three \ncategories are above 80%, and three evaluation indexes of healthy is the \nhighest. For the healthy category in severity category, precision, recall \nand F1-score were 99.71%, 99.50% and 99.60%, respectively.

However, current SwinT can only work under a single \nclassification task, but not suitable for multitask classifications. Specif­\nically, it can be used for identification of a type of disease under a kind of \nseverity (e.g., a serious crab leaf), but not for identifying disease and \nseverity separately (e.g., serious and crab leaf). The latter, obviously, is \nmore applicable because it helps to decrease the number of classes and \nsimplifies the classification tasks. \nTo this end, we design a TST module containing sharing part and \ntriple-branch part to extract features for multitask classifications, among \nwhich one branch specialized for identifying diseases, one branch for \nidentifying severity, and the other branch for deep supervision. The TST \nmodule includes four stages, with each stage consisted of a patch \nmerging or a linear embedding block and several SwinT blocks (Liu",

Therefore, accurate identification of plant disease and \nseverity is more important, and a new strategy for identifying disease \nand severity is needed, which can improve the versatility and general­\nizability in the task of plant disease identification. However, as far as is \nknow, we are unaware of any work that conducts multitask for identi­\nfying disease and severity simultaneously and separately. \nTo tackle this problem, this paper built a triple-branch SwinT clas­\nsification (TSTC) network to achieve multitask, in order to separate \nclassification of disease and severity for the flexibility of plant disease \nclassification. SwinT can pay attention to the relevant information of \nother adjacent windows, has excellent performance in feature extrac­\ntion. Therefore, we designed a triple-branch SwinT (TST) module based \non SwinT for feature extraction, and then compact bilinear pooling \n(CBP) was utilized to enhance the discrimination ability of extracting \nfeature of disease.
